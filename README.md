# Python OOP Principles Project

Designed and developed by: Farnaz Zinnah

## About the Project

This project is a collection of Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and examples, demonstrating key principles of OOP like classes, objects, methods, and more, all applied in Python.

### Description and Purpose

- Demonstrates basic to advanced OOP concepts in Python.
- Provides real-world examples to solidify understanding.
- Serves as a reference guide for Python OOP.

## Tech Stack

- Python
- GitHub for version control

## Features and Examples

1. **Class and Object Creation**: Introduction to Python classes and objects with simple examples.
2. **Method Definitions and Calls**: Exploring how methods are defined and used in Python OOP.
3. **Inheritance and Polymorphism**: Demonstrating Python's capabilities for inheriting and overriding methods.

### Key Concepts Covered:

- ✅ **Constructor and Initialization**: Understanding `__init__` and its role in classes.
- ✅ **Encapsulation**: Showcasing private and public members in a Python class.
- ✅ **Abstraction**: Simplifying complex reality by modeling classes focused on relevant information.
- ✅ **Attribute Management**: Managing and accessing class and instance attributes.
- ✅ **Special Methods**: Utilizing Python's special methods like `__repr__` for object representation.

### Custom Code Examples:

- ✅ **Tutoring Center Simulation**: A class representing a tutoring center scenario.
- ✅ **Family Tree Representation**: Implementing a family tree using classes.

### Challenges and Exercises

- Hands-on challenges for each OOP concept.
- Exercises designed to test understanding and application skills.
